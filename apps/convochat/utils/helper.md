Examples and use cases for these two fields to illustrate how they can be used in the ConvoInsight platform.

1. `recommendation` field in AIText model:
```python
recommendation = models.ForeignKey('analysis.Recommendation', on_delete=models.SET_NULL, null=True, blank=True, related_name='applied_messages')
```

Examples and Use Cases:

a) Tracking Applied Recommendations:
   When an agent uses a recommendation provided by the LLM, you can link the resulting message to that recommendation.

   Example:
   ```python
   # When an agent applies a recommendation
   recommendation = Recommendation.objects.get(id=1)  # Get a specific recommendation
   ai_message = AIText.objects.create(
       conversation=conversation,
       content="Thank you for your patience. I understand your frustration with the delayed shipment. Let me check the status for you right away.",
       is_from_user=False,
       recommendation=recommendation
   )
   ```

b) Analyzing Recommendation Effectiveness:
   You can use this field to evaluate how often recommendations are being used and their impact on customer satisfaction.

   Use Case:
   ```python
   # Analyzing the effectiveness of recommendations
   total_recommendations = Recommendation.objects.count()
   applied_recommendations = AIText.objects.exclude(recommendation=None).count()
   application_rate = applied_recommendations / total_recommendations

   # Get all messages that applied recommendations
   applied_messages = AIText.objects.filter(recommendation__isnull=False)
   
   # Analyze customer responses to these messages
   for message in applied_messages:
       next_user_message = UserText.objects.filter(
           conversation=message.conversation,
           created__gt=message.created
       ).first()
       if next_user_message:
           # Analyze sentiment, etc.
           pass
   ```

c) Recommendation Improvement:
   By linking messages to recommendations, you can gather data on which types of recommendations are most effective in different scenarios.

   Use Case:
   ```python
   # Identify most effective recommendations
   from django.db.models import Avg
   
   effective_recommendations = Recommendation.objects.annotate(
       avg_satisfaction=Avg('applied_messages__conversation__performance_evaluations__customer_satisfaction_score')
   ).order_by('-avg_satisfaction')
   
   for rec in effective_recommendations[:10]:
       print(f"Recommendation: {rec.content[:50]}... Avg Satisfaction: {rec.avg_satisfaction}")
   ```

2. `agent` field in Conversation model:
```python
agent = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.SET_NULL, null=True, blank=True, related_name='handled_conversations')
```

Examples and Use Cases:

a) Assigning Conversations to Agents:
   When a new conversation starts or is transferred, you can assign it to a specific agent.

   Example:
   ```python
   # Assigning a conversation to an agent
   agent = User.objects.get(username='agent_smith')
   conversation = Conversation.objects.create(
       title="Product Inquiry",
       user=customer,
       agent=agent,
       status=Conversation.Status.ACTIVE
   )
   ```

b) Analyzing Agent Workload:
   You can use this field to track how many active conversations each agent is handling.

   Use Case:
   ```python
   from django.db.models import Count
   
   agent_workload = User.objects.annotate(
       active_conversations=Count('handled_conversations', filter=models.Q(handled_conversations__status=Conversation.Status.ACTIVE))
   ).order_by('-active_conversations')
   
   for agent in agent_workload:
       print(f"Agent: {agent.username}, Active Conversations: {agent.active_conversations}")
   ```

c) Performance Evaluation:
   This field allows you to easily associate conversations with specific agents for performance analysis.

   Use Case:
   ```python
   # Evaluating an agent's performance
   agent = User.objects.get(username='agent_smith')
   agent_performance = AgentPerformance.objects.filter(agent=agent)
   
   avg_response_time = agent_performance.aggregate(Avg('response_time'))['response_time__avg']
   avg_satisfaction = agent_performance.aggregate(Avg('customer_satisfaction_score'))['customer_satisfaction_score__avg']
   
   print(f"Agent: {agent.username}")
   print(f"Average Response Time: {avg_response_time}")
   print(f"Average Customer Satisfaction: {avg_satisfaction}")
   ```

d) Routing and Load Balancing:
   You can use this field to implement intelligent routing of new conversations to agents based on their current workload and expertise.

   Use Case:
   ```python
   def assign_conversation_to_agent(conversation):
       available_agents = User.objects.annotate(
           active_conversations=Count('handled_conversations', filter=models.Q(handled_conversations__status=Conversation.Status.ACTIVE))
       ).filter(active_conversations__lt=5)  # Agents handling fewer than 5 active conversations
       
       if available_agents.exists():
           least_busy_agent = available_agents.order_by('active_conversations').first()
           conversation.agent = least_busy_agent
           conversation.save()
           return True
       return False
   ```

These examples demonstrate how the `recommendation` and `agent` fields can be used to implement key features of the ConvoInsight platform, including tracking recommendation effectiveness, managing agent workloads, and performing detailed performance analyses. These fields provide the necessary connections between conversations, agents, and recommendations, allowing for comprehensive insights into your customer service operations.
