   - Implement enhancements and new features



### Here's a brief explanation of how each tool fits into the project:

- **Django**: Serves as the main web framework for building the backend of your application.
- **Django Channels**: Enables real-time functionality through WebSockets, which is crucial for live updates in your conversational platform.
- **Celery**: Handles asynchronous task processing, which is essential for running time-consuming operations like LLM analysis without blocking the main application.
- **PostgreSQL**: Acts as the primary database for storing structured data.
- **pgvector**: Enables efficient storage and similarity search of vector embeddings, which is useful for semantic search and recommendation systems.
- **ASGI/WSGI**: ASGI (Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface) is used for handling WebSocket connections through Django Channels, while WSGI (Web Server Gateway Interface) is used for traditional HTTP requests.
- **Langchain**: Facilitates the integration and fine-tuning of Large Language Models, making it easier to implement advanced NLP tasks.

This plan provides a structured approach to building the Customer Conversational Intelligence Platform. It covers all aspects from initial setup to deployment and iteration.
